 A1
Requirement
Create a live website hosted on Google App Engine. You will know that you have done this when you can access your site via https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com. If you are accessing a site that ends with :8080 then you are working on a development server and the site is not live. Your submission MUST be publicly available. 

The site you make must be non-static, which means you need something that can respond to the user in some way. Furthermore, the site must have some sort of server side interactivity. E.g., using client side JavaScript to make the site interactive is insufficient to meet the requirements.

Note:

If you follow the Python tutorial up to the required section, you can deploy an application that meets the server-side interactivity criterion.
If you follow the complete Node.js tutorial you will get close to the requirements, but not all the way there. You will have a site with a form which sends data to your sever. However, the message displayed to the user doesn't use this data and hence there is no server-side interactivity. You can meet the server-side interactivity criterion by making a small code change to send back a message that includes the name entered by the user.
You are allowed to create and deploy a completely different application as long as the server-side interactivity criterion is met.
